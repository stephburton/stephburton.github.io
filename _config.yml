# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi! I'm Steph and I'm what you might call a "jack of all trades" when it comes to tech. I've done everything from image editing to upgrading Kubernetes clusters. I'm no expert, but I do love to learn. If you're eager to grow your tech knowledge beyond the basics but you feel intimidated, know you're in good company. Let's learn and be fearless, together.
