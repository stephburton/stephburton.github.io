title:  "Blogging Fears"
---

Since I began sharing my blog I’ve been feeling a lot of fear. It’s really hard to expose yourself like this. Especially when you’re unemployed and looking for work.

I recently heard part of an Elizabeth Gilbert talk where she mentioned a strategy she uses to deal with fear. She writes a letter from the perspective of her fear, listing everything she’s afraid of. She said this list ends up being surprisingly short, and it enables her to find her courage and move forward.

So what am I so afraid of? Let’s go through the list:

1. I find a role I really want and I apply. A recruiter for this role finds my blog, reads my posts and thinks “This person knows nothing. I’m going to pass on this candidate.”
2. Someone I really respect reads my posts and thinks I’m an idiot and this somehow comes back to bite me in the ass.
3. I fail to keep up with posting content and this gives a potential employer the impression that I can’t stick with anything.

Honestly, that’s it. It is a short list, indeed. But there’s a theme here: I’m afraid of what others will think of me.

However there is another way to look at all of this. When I put on my manager/coach hat, I see clear benefits in each of these scenarios if they were to come true. In each scenario, me sharing my work is acting as a “bullshit filter” of sorts. Here’s what I mean by that:

- A potential employer is unable to see my value beyond credentials and work experience. Or…
- …a potential employer hastily hires me, only to find out I don’t have the skills required to do the core parts of the job. And then I quit or get fired.

By blogging about my professional development and sharing what I’ve learned, I’m allowing others to get to know me and where I am in my career.

I’m also sharing my soft skills, which don’t necessarily translate well to a resume. As a former manager I always appreciated when a potential hire demonstrated a willingness to learn, curiosity and enthusiasm for the work. Technical skills can be taught, but these soft skills are way harder to acquire.

With that, I’m going to summon the courage to share my blog on LinkedIn today. It’s terrifying, but I know putting myself out there is worth the risk.
